1,GB,y,y,y,y,"For my job I had to use some reverse engineering to figure out how a piece of perl code in our company worked, in order to add to it (making sure all data being sent over the internal network used TLS). I was relatively new to both topics, and my main guidance was a beginner's perl book and countless resources online about TLS encryption. I thought the hands on experience really solidified the knowledge I had read, and greatly improved my understanding of how TLS works.

I started by trying to figure out what user to connect as. I looked at the source code on github, starting at the main program pytfpd.py, and used the different messages I received in response to my login attempts to figure out which configuration files were being loaded for authentication. I used this to determine that logging in as ""ftp"" or ""anonymous"" worked, as long as the password/email field contained the ""@"" character. I also used the different message replies to determine that there was only 1 accepted user account with a password, called admin. I found the admin password hash under the file auth_db_config.py and determined from auth_db_module.py that it was a base64 encoded md5 hash. This info helped me crack the password (""reverseengineering"") - while I could have used a tool like John the Ripper I was lazy and just searched it on an online site (crackstation.net). However I got stuck after this point. Every time I tried to issue a command as either admin, ftp, or anonymous, I got the reply ""your dataport sucks big time!"" which I determined from pyftpd.py was a result of a socket error. I suspect this is due to the FTP server being behind the SSH gateway server. So I tried passive mode, since this was hinted at in the link provided in my initial instructions regarding how to connect. Since the chosen port in passive mode was static, I thought I'd be able to forward the port (p1*256 + p2) through SSH, but I think my FTP client was always trying to reach out to 172.20.29.2 and not localhost, as all my connection attempts timed out.

It improve my understanding ver much.",2,none,"At first I will google the idea of reverse engineering and its application, basic concept and examples. Then I checked the hint according to my birth month. However, I get stuck at the beginning as I cannot connect to the ftp server based on the hint so I can not move forward.",3,y,4,I have no knowledge of reverse engineering at all before. ,x,x,None,y,Yes it will be great if more guidence can be provided.,"I think the hint is not very helpful and since I did not make it, I still can not make it if I have less guidence. So no impact.",Yes I think they are too challenging for people with no background of cybersecurity so it aim not for everyone. It would be great if more introduction and tutorial about how to move forward even if get stuck at some point are provided.,I like it because it provide different hint for different people so I believe there would be more than one way to solve it. I did not check the other people’s hint but I am really curious about it. Very great design. However it is too difficult to me.
6,GB,y,y,y,y,"Experience - As part of COMPSCI 561, I got hands-on experience on system hacking concepts likes password cracking, arp/dns poisoning etc. Solving CTF challenges enhance the conceptual understanding of several topics like Buffer overflow, etc. My survey project was on privilege escalation where I did 2 small labs on exploiting sudo access and unquoted service path vulnerability. 1. I had basic networking and cryptography knowledge. But this is my first experience with system hacking course. I didn't know about any of the hacking techniques taught is class beforehand. 2. For this course COMPSCI 561, hands-on activities involved labs and CTFs. Labs were fully guided and we had reference text book to refer to the concepts and commands. Did not get much guidance on CTF challenges. 3. Activities were complete on my own time outside class. 4. I learned a lot from CTF challenges and lab. So it was worth the time. 5. Yes, this way of learning was long lasting. It definitely enhanced my understanding of the topic.",2,yes,"My birth month is January so I started with instruction set 0. Initially I assumed this challenge to be password cracking challenge and something to do with exploiting some vulnerability with mentioned ftp version. So I used metasploit to serach for exploits and tried ftp_login. I tried list of user names and passwords - unix_usernames and unix_passwords. But that did not work. Next I read through ftp commands from link given in URL, but most of them worked only after connecting to ftp server. So I gave up on that. I opened github repository and navigated some files but did not understand where to look exactly. So I gain started by search for exploits with ftp version. I finally opened other instruction sets to see if there is any additional information on this. Instruction set 2 paved the path for solving this challenge. It helped to navigate to right places in github repo. I searched in auth_db_config and auth_db_module. Reversed the hash of user admin using lines 7 to 12 in auth_db_config. Used python script for a2b_base64 and online md5 decrypt tool. After successful login, I was stuck for some time as I expected to directly access flag.txt. Tried random commands - ls, cat, pwd, cd etc. Finally using list command gave hint about trying PORT command. But that was confusing so I saw a youtube video on PASV, PORT. But still got stuck on what to do with this new port. Finally realized the client server setup tunneling and how server is sending response to client. Finally used list and retr to get the flag.",8-10,y,4,Not very familiar. I used some reverse engineering technique back in my work at Oracle. In my work experience looking at data I tried to reproduce the issue on internal pods. Data state revealed a lot about steps that customer would have performed.,x,x,great,y,"More guidance as in instruction set 2 actually made things fall in line, so learning was restricted in some sense. I just followed the instructions of navigating into the github repo. Learning was with regards to reversing had function and FTP commands.","That could have definitely enhanced the learning but also felt like stagnation. As there was no clue what was expected. May be reading more resources could have helped. But due to limited time, I did not prefer that way.",None except the instruction set fairness.,"I really liked the challenge as it enhance knowledge on reverse engineering, hashing, ftp commands, client server setup etc. I disliked the fact that instruction set 0 was not verbose to help navigate the code."
8,GB,y,y,y,y,Slightly familiar with material taught. A lot of instructions and steps were given to understand the topic and it helped in getting a deeper understanding,2,None,The thought process was to solve the problem step by step and reverse engineer and understand the vulnerabilites of FTP,2-3,n,3,Only knew about the basic concepts,x,x,slight,n,No impact,Less learning and more difficulty solving,Have more parts to the challenge to make it more interesting,Great way to learn about reverse engineering
7,GB,y,y,y,y,"Yes, I've used hands-on activities to learn cybersecurity topics in the subject System Defense and Test. I was not very familiar with the material being taught. The activity was an assignment which came with complete set of instructions that walked one through all steps involved in pen testing. Yes, the activity was definitely an effective way to utilize the time and also helped improve my understanding of the topic. ",2,Yes,"The instruction set asked me to look at the pyftpd.py file. On line 618 the program was importing different modules, based on which I checked the auth_db_config.py file which had the usernames and the password hashes as explained in the notes. To decode the hash, I first decoded the base64 and got the hex output which was the md5 hash. I decoded the hash and found the pass of admin (reverseengineering). I then used a nc to connect to the ftp server and logged in. Then I used the port function to setup the dataport and used this to list the files and eventually get the contents of flag.txt.",9,,4,,x,x,great,n,I feel the current set of instructions were sufficient and more guidance would have reduced my learning.,I feel the current set of instructions were apt and less guidance would have resulted in me spending more time and feeling more lost.,"No, I found the challenge to be the right level of instructive and challenging.",Reverse engineering is one of the most common type of attacks and having a challenge on it was very helpful.
