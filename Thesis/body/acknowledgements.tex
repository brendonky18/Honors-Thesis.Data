I want to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Parviz Kermani for all of his incredible help, guidance, and patience, over the past years. 
Taking CS 590A (now CS 561) with you opened my eyes to the realm of cybersecurity. 
Much thanks is also owed to Anand Gopakumar, who was a tremendous help in hosting and deploying the experiment activities, and to the students of CS 561 for taking their time to participate. 
	
Additionally, I would also like to thank all of my friends, I would not have made it this far without your support. 
Special thanks are owed to Luis Alvernaz, for confirming that I do in fact know what I am talking about; 
to Micah Hsi, and Anthony Rinaldi for distracting me just enough to keep me from losing my sanity; 
and to Harrison Zeiberg for reminding me that I am more than capable of writing a thesis an order of magnitude shorter than yours. 

Finally, a large thanks to my whole family. 
In particular, thank you to my Mom and Dad, Unsuk and Bunthoeun, for your unconditional love and support, and for being the generous financial benefactors for this entire operation; 
and also to my sister Rasmee, for indefatigably reminding me how to use commas correctly.
