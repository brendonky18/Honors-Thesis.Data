I want to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Parviz Kermani for all of his incredible help, guidance, and patience, over the past years. %%
Taking CS 590A (now CS 561) with you opened my eyes to the realm of cybersecurity. %%
Much thanks is also owed to Anand Gopakumar, who was a tremendous help in hosting and deploying the experiment activities. 
	
Additionally, I would also like to thank all of my friends, I would not have made it this far without your support. %%
Special thanks are owed to Luis Alvernaz, for confirming that I do in fact know what I am talking about; %%
to Micah Hsi, and Anthony Rinaldi for distracting me just enough to keep me from losing my sanity; %%
and to Harrison Zeiberg for reminding me that I am more than capable of writing a thesis an order of magnitude shorter than yours. 

Finally, a large thanks to my whole family. %%
In particular, thank you to my Mom and Dad, Unsuk and Bunthoeun, for your unconditional love and support, and for being the generous financial benefactors for this entire operation; %%
and also to my sister Rasmee, for indefatigably reminding me how to use commas correctly.
