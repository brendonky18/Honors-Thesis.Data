\section{Student Surveys}
    The raw student surveys are available online, however in some cases, parts of this data is missing. 
    To remedy this, I reached out individually and some students were able to provide responses. 
    These responses do not appear in the original PDFs, however they are included in a CSV file, which includes all of the collated data that was collected from the surveys and by contacting students individually. 

    The individual surveys and collated data can all be found in a \href{https://github.com/brendonky18/Honors-Thesis.Data}{github repository}.
